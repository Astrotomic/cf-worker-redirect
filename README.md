Simple URL redirection running at the edge with Cloudflare Workers and Worker KV.

</div>

## ‚≠ê Features

- **Extremely fast** - *Runs on Cloudflare's Edge*
- **Simple to integrate** - *Integrate it with existing sites using Cloudflare*
- **Easy to manage** - *Redirects are stored in Workers KV*
- **Supports URL parameters** - *URL parameters are appended to the target URL if not already present*
- **Works in front of an existing website** - *If no redirect is found it can pass the request to the origin*

## üöÄ Get started

Ensure you have [`wrangler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) installed and configured, then create a new Worker based on this repo:

```
wrangler generate cf-worker-redirect https://github.com/betahuhn/cf-worker-redirect && cd cf-worker-redirect
```

Set your account id in `wrangler.toml`, which can be found on your [Workers Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers).

Create a KV namespace for cf-worker-redirect:

```
wrangler kv:namespace create "REDIRECT_KV"
```

You will be instructed to append some content to `wrangler.toml`.

Publish your Worker and start using it: `wrangler publish`

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/BetaHuhn/cf-worker-redirect)

## üìö Usage

After you have deployed your Worker, head over to the [KV section of the Workers Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/kv/namespaces) and select your Namespace.

To add a redirect, simply enter the URL path you want to redirect as the key (including the leading `/`) and the target URL as the value.

Example:

| Key | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `/github` | `https://github.com/BetaHuhn` |

If your your Worker runs on example.com, all requests to example.com/github will be redirected to https://github.com/BetaHuhn.

If you have multiple domains pointing to the same worker, you can specify the domain in front of the path to target it specifically.

Example:

| Key | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `example.com/github` | `https://github.com/BetaHuhn` |
| `example2.com/github` | `https://github.com/` |
| `/foo` | `https://example3.com/bar` |

Both example.com/foo and example2.com/foo will redirect to example3.com/bar

### Root page

Since a key in your KV Namespace specifies a URL path with or without the domain, you can also specify a redirect if a user requests the root of your page (i.e. example.com/):

| Key | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `/` | `https://example.com/home` |
| `example.com/` | `https://example.com/home` |

### 404 Page

By default if a path is not found in the KV Namespace a 404 error will be returned. You can optionally redirect all 404 errors to a custom URL by specifying it with the `404` key:

| Key | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `404` | `https://example.com/home` |
| `example.com/404` | `https://example.com/home` |

### In front of origin

If you use the worker in front of your actual website, you can tell the worker to pass requests to the origin if no redirect is found:

| Key | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `404` | `pass` |

You can also use the `pass` value on any other key:

| Key | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `example.com/home` | `pass` |

### URL parameters

All URL search parameters will be passed on to the final URL if they are not already present in the specified target URL.

Example with a Worker running at example.com:

| Key | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `/blog-post-test` | `https://example.com/blog/posts/test` |

A user requesting example.com/blog-post-test?ref=Twitter will be redirected to https://example.com/blog/posts/test?ref=Twitter.

> If the specified target URL would have been `https://example.com/blog/posts/test?ref=Campaign` then the parameter `ref=Twitter` would have been ignored

## üíª Available commands

- run `yarn lint` or `npm run lint` to run eslint.
- run `yarn test` or `npm run test` to run all Mocha tests.
- run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to run the Worker locally with [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/commands#dev).
- run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to produce a production version with webpack.
